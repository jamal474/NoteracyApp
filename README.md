## Design:

## Database:

**2 Models :**
- User: Stores everything about the user including displayName, firstName, lastName, profileImage, and createdAt.
- Notes: Stores a single note instance for a user and includes details like user, title, body, and createdAt.


## Server-Side :
**Rest API :** 
- Express server with 3 routes:
  - **auth :** Authentication route that checks if user already has an account in the platform. If not, it inserts a new user, using passportJS's passport-google-oauth20 strategy.
  - **dashboard :** Handles all the requests after login for notes view etc.
  - **user :** to confirm authentication status of user anytime.

## Client-Side :
Front-end was made using **React.js** with **react-router** for routing and **react-helmet** for custom head.
